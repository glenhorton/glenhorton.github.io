<h2>About Glen</h2>

<p><img style="float:right; margin:.4em 0 .7em 1em; -webkit-filter: grayscale(100%); filter: grayscale(100%);" src="/images/glenhorton-200-150x150.png" alt="Glen Horton" />I'm Glen.  I spent my childhood in Chicago, but I've spent most of my life in SouthWest Ohio.  I currently live in Cincinnati with my family and two hungry cats.</p>

<p>Over the past few years I've made lots of big changes to live a more meaningful and less stressful life.  So I now consider myself a recovering perfectionist.  I've also embraced <a href="http://www.theminimalists.com/minimalism/">minimalism</a> so I can focus on the things that matter in my life and simplify as much as possible (like this simple website).  That means owning less, doing less, and worrying less.  It's a work in progress.</p> 

<p>I'm cultivating several areas of interest right now:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Exploring and practicing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_Buddhism">Secular Buddhism</a></li>
  <li>Practicing yoga and meditation</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurohacking">Neurohacking</a></li>
  <li>Exercising</li>
  <li>Spending time in nature</li>
  <li>Learning to juggle (it's hard)</li>
  <li>Exploring new music</li>
  <li>Reading</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm passionate about libraries and free access to information.  I'm also passionate about technology, especially open source software and web applications.  I started supporting technologies in libraries in 1992 while I attended Wright State University.  I've worked with all types of libraries over the years and I'm now a senior software developer for the University of Cincinnati Libraries. Most of my time is spent developing open source projects like <a href = "https://scholar.uc.edu">Scholar@UC.</a></p>

<p>Random tidbits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>My full name is Glendon Desmond Horton.  It was my grandfather's name.</li>
