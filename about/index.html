<h2>About Glen</h2>

<p><img style="float:right; margin:.4em 0 .7em 1em;" src="/images/glenhorton-2020-150x150.png" alt="Glen Horton" />I'm Glen.  I spent my childhood in Chicago, but I've spent most of my life in SouthWest Ohio.  I currently live in Cincinnati with my family and <del>two</del> <em>four</em> hungry cats.</p>

<p>Over the past few years I've made lots of big changes to live a more meaningful and less stressful life.  I now consider myself a recovering perfectionist.  I've also embraced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living#Reducing_consumption,_work_time,_and_possessions">minimalism</a> so I can focus on the things that matter in my life and simplify as much as possible (like this simple website).  That means owning less, doing less, and worrying less.  It's a work in progress.</p> 

<p>What am I up to now? (updated 3/1/20)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trying to focus on the important things (which aren't things)</li>
  <li>Practicing yoga and meditation</li>
  <li>Hobbling around on crutches following knee surgery</li>
  <li>Pursuing my Masters in Information Technology from UC</li>
  <li><em>Trying</em> to learn new juggling tricks (it's hard)</li>
  <li>Exploring new types of music (mostly Lo-Fi and Downtempo right now)</li>
  <li>Reading <u>Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less</u> by Greg McKeown</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm passionate about libraries and free access to information.  I'm also passionate about technology, especially open source software and web applications.  I started supporting technologies in libraries in 1992 while I attended Wright State University.  Over the past 25 years I've helped public, academic, school, and special libraries use technology to provide better services to their patrons.
  
<p>I currently lead the Application Development Unit at the University of Cincinnati Libraries. Most of my time is spent leading a group of developers on open source projects like <a href = "https://scholar.uc.edu">Scholar@UC</a> using agile practices.</p>

<p>Random tidbits:</p>
