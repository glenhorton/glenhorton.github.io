<h2>About Glen</h2>

<p><img style="float:right; margin:.4em 0 .7em 1em; -webkit-filter: grayscale(100%); filter: grayscale(100%);" src="/images/glenhorton-200-150x150.png" alt="Glen Horton" />I'm Glen.  I live with my wife and two kids in Cincinnati where we belong to two cats.  I'm from Chicago, but moved to SouthWest Ohio with my family when I was a kid.  My wife and I met in ninth grade. (but she wasn't my wife back then) :p</p>

<p>I'm a recovering perfectionist.  I was never perfect, of course, but the struggle to try and be perfect led to a lot of stress.  So I'm not trying so hard anymore.  I've been practicing <a href="http://www.theminimalists.com/minimalism/">minimalism</a> to focus on the things that matter in my life and rid myself of the rest.  Meditation, yoga, and exercise help with that too!</p>

<p>I'm passionate libraries and free access to information.  I'm also passionate about technology, especially open source software and web applications.  I started supporting technologies in libraries in 1992 while I attended Wright State University.  I've worked with all types of libraries over the years, but I'm now a software developer for the University of Cincinnati Libraries working on open source projects like <a href = "https://scholar.uc.edu">Scholar@UC.</a></p>
