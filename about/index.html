<h2>About Glen</h2>

<h3>@ Work</h3>
<p><img style="float:right; margin:.4em 0 .7em 1em;" src="/images/glenhorton-200-150x150.png" alt="Glen Horton" />I am a software developer for the <a href="http://www.libraries.uc.edu">University of Cincinnati Libraries</a>. We are currently building a next-generation digital repository based on the open source <a href="http://projecthydra.org/community-2-2/partners-and-more/university-of-cincinnati/">Hydra Project</a>.</p>
<p>I previously served as the Digital Services Manager for <a href="http://www.cc-pl.org">Campbell County Public Library</a> where I was responsible for all things digital including the library's digital branch, online events, and social media.  Before that, I spent eleven years as the Technology Coordinator &#038; Assistant Director for <a href="http://www.swonlibraries.org">SWON Libraries</a> where I provided technology consultation and technology training for libraries.</p>
<p>My areas of expertise include web development, social media, open source software, mobile computing, and <a href="/presentations/">speaking about technology</a>.</p>
<h3>@ Home</h3>
<p>I live in Cincinnati with my wife, <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/glen.horton/MaxAndMacy">two kids</a>, and two hungry cats.  I am very much a geek, but am often mis-labeled a dork.  I try to spend my free time enjoying music and exploring new technology, but I usually just get suckered into playing with my kids.</p>
